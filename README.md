# Hotel Management System - Java Project

TOPIC: Hotel Management System


OBJECTIVES: To develop a single platform where all the operations of a hotel can perform e.g. — booking, reservation, housekeeping, service management, customer records, staff records, food for customers, billing, etc. The main motive of this project is to provide the user with a hotel management platform with all the necessary functionalities.

APPROACH: For handling such a huge database, we needed a reliable and relational database. So, we used MySQL to store all information in the form of 6 Tables in the database which includes —staff info table, room info table, customer info table, room booking info table, restaurant menu table and food booking table. These tables can be used to extract data as well as manipulate data. Tables can also be altered, if required. All the bookings information is unique because of a Booking ID which is the primary key of the table. This table is connected to other tables in respect to other columns such as aadhaar no. of customer and room no.

RESULTS: A login portal authorises a user (staff) to use the platform for different purposes. The user gets switched to the main screen where there are are 5 navigations. Now , the user can book a room (details get added to the booking info table as well as customer info table) , take food order from a room (details get added to the food booking table and total bill) , see customer information , other staffs information , availability of rooms and their types (from the room table) and change the menu of the restaurant according to the availability of the items(from rest menu table)
